I am Shumin An, a graduate student at ECE Department in New York University. Due to the covid-19, I deferred my admission and decided to go to Shanghai for Spring 2021. Hope everything will be fine and go to NYC as soon as possible. 

I worked as a Quant Analyst Intern at Yearone Investment, from spring 2019 to fall 2020, focusing on using Machine Learning techniques combining fundamental analysis in future index and options trading.  

Broad-speaking, my interests evolve around machine learning and optimization, say, proving convergence or analyzing empirical behaviors of optimizers. However, there is still a long way to go. Also, I find my self more and more interested in inverse problems. From l1-norm to GAN prior, and the data-free part from Deep Image Prior is truly amazing. And here comes to the questions: How can we analyze it theoretically? For some applications, Deep Image Prior critically requires additional regularization in the form of early stopping the optimization, how to explain that?   

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2020.
