I am Shumin An, a graduate student at ECE Department in New York University. Due to the covid-19, I deferred my admission and attended Go-Local program in Shanghai for Spring 2021. Hope everything will be fine and go to NYC as soon as possible. 

I am working as a Quant Researcher at Yearone Investment, starting from Spring 2019, focusing on Options and Index Futures Trading. I am also working with Prof. Ivan Selesnick(https://eeweb.engineering.nyu.edu/iselesni/) on sparse index tracking via nonconvex regularizer.

Broad-speaking, my interests evolve around optimization and machine learning theory. Also, I find my self more and more interested in the intersection of signal processing and finance. It's amazing that signal processing is actually everywhere in financial engineering, and I believe there is still much things to be done in this area.
